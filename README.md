Remote "browse" button for Deluge
==========

This is a plugin for [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org) torrent client.
By default, when started in **client-server mode**, Deluge has no option to choose destination folder for download, you have to enter it by hand.
The **Remote "browse" button** plugin eliminates this drawback by adding `Browse..` button to *"Add torrent"* dialog. 

[Download](https://github.com/dredkin/deluge-rbb/releases) .egg file for python 2.6 and 2.7.
If you have another version of python, make an .egg file by running build.sh or build.bat depending on platform.
